FILter, formatters, handlers loggers



# LOGGER
Loggers are actually used. have a `logger.info` e.g.
This createas a `LogRecords` that contains all kinds of information. 
Loggers each have filters and a level to drop certain `LogRecords`

THe loger passes the LogRecord to one or more handlers
Each handler has:
    - levels
    - filters 
    - formatter (from `LogRecord` to a `string`) - what should an individual message look like


# The logging tree
The root logger can have many children. 
`Logger A.X` will pass the log to each of its handlers and then to the parent logger: `Logger.A`
`Logger A` will then pass the log to each of *its handlers and then to its parten : `Root Logger`
If `Logger A.X` filters out a log, this log will not propagate to the parent but if `Logger A`s handler drops a log it will propagate up either way


# TIP: Put all handlers on the root logger
This wil make sure that all messages generated by third-party libraries get logged and formatted the same way as your own app. 
The same with filters; put all on the root logger
put propagation ON

# but don't use the root logger like logging.info.
Just use logging.getLogger("name").

Make one non-root-logger for every MAJOR subcomponent of the app



# configuring using dict config
in `"disable_existing_loggers": false` this means that we will not disable existing loggers but propagate them up (like sqlalchemy etc.)
in `"stream": "ext://sys.stdout"`, external means that it's defined outside of this config

find all format fields in [logging doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes)
